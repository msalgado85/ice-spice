    <center> <h2 class="ice">The start of it all</h2>
<p class="spice">Isis Naija Gaston (born January 1, 2000), known professionally as Ice Spice, is an American rapper. Born and raised in the Bronx in New York City, she embarked on her musical career while studying at college in 2021 after meeting producer RiotUSA.</p>
<h2 class="ice">Viral Songs</h2>
   <p class="spice"> Ice Spice first gained major recognition in late 2022 with her song "Munch (Feelin' U)", which achieved viral popularity on TikTok. After signing with 10K Projects in a joint venture with Capitol Records, she released the follow-up singles "Bikini Bottom" and "In Ha Mood" in promotion for her debut extended play (EP), Like..? (2023). The EP contained the Billboard Hot 100-charting song "Gangsta Boo" (featuring Lil Tjay), spawned the single "Princess Diana" (with Nicki Minaj), and contained the single "Deli" on its deluxe edition. She saw further mainstream success with her collaborative singles that same year; "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2" (with PinkPantheress), "Karma" (with Taylor Swift), and "Barbie World" (with Nicki Minaj and Aqua) each peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, making Ice Spice the first rapper to release four songs which did so that year. Her 2024 single, "Think U the Shit (Fart)" is preceding the release of her forthcoming debut studio album,[3] Y2K!.[4][5]</p>
